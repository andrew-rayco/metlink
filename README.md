# My Metlink app
This is a simple app that consumes the unofficial Metlink API.

It simply checks the next bus ony my route either heading to town or to home, and shows how long until the bus is expected.

Some real-world testing will need to be done to check the timing accuracy of the data.

### Todo
- Real-world testing
- More robust error handling when data not complete
